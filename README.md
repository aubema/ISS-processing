# ISS-processing
Image processing based on SAVESTARS SL preprocessed ISS images. Outputs of the software are the Melatonin Suppression Index (MSI), the Visual radiance, and the MSI impact defined as the product of the MSI with the visual radiance. The software can also produce inputs for the Illumina model.


This software is intend to be use you with the [Illumina model](https://github.com/aubema/illumina) that you can install from this [guide](https://lx02.cegepsherbrooke.qc.ca/~aubema/index.php/Prof/IlluminaGuide2021).
